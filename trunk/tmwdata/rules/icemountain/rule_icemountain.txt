# ice mountains. In this Ruleset you have 3 colors setting
# the height of the current tile:
# black: usual height
# light red: above
# dark red: below
# the transitions "black<->dark red" and "black<->light red" can be mapped with
# this ruleset.
# When you wan to have more than 3 different heights, you should use the
# transition "light red<->dark red". So there is no wall at this transition and
# you can start over from the red to black, having a wall to another height.
