.:: Dependencies ::.

	* ant (recent version)
	* J2SE 5 or higher (or equivalent)
	* tiled-core.jar (in this directory)
	* tmw.jar (in this directory)

.:: Compilation ::.

	* Run ant from this directory.
	ant

.:: Usage ::.

	* Create a directory called tmwdata containing the client data
	( can be symlink: ln -s ../../../tmwdata )

	* Output will be in a directory called server-data
	( can be made a link, but is not recommended. )

	* If the aforementioned jar files are in class path you can run the
	converter jar file directly:

        java -jar converter.jar

      Otherwise, the Converter class can handle that for you:

        java Converter
